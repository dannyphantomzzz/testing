This is Sekolah Kebangsaan Presint 9 (1). I used to study here before I moved to Kedah in the middle of grade 2. What I remember from this school is when I was in grade 1, every student had to wear a name tag with a random word in English, and I got the word 'hurt'.

This is Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Dusun, my elementary school. I study here from grade 2 to grade 6. My favorite subject at this time is science. The most memorable event that happens is when our batch goes on a trip to Muzium Padi in Alor Star and we spend a whole day there.

This is Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sik, my secondary school. I study here from form 1 until form 5. I have a lot of memories here, sweet and bitter memories. My sweetest memory here is when my friend and I skipped school for a whole day without getting caught. Meanwhile, the bitter one is when a day police came to our classroom for a bullying case. I finished my secondary class here and got my PT3 and SPM here
