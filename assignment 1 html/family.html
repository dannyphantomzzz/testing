This is my family. My father's name is Md Suhaili Bin Hamid, and my mother's is Muslira Binti Muhamad. My twin brother's name is Muhammad Irfan Danial. He's the same age as me: 20. Next is my younger sister, Nur Irdina Damia, and last but not least, my younger brother, Muhammad Iqbal Danial. One of our favorite traditions is celebrating birthdays with a cake or go holiday. In my family, we believe in love, respect, and standing by each other no matter what. They are my biggest strength and happiness.
